                        &ensp;My name is Daniel Arpide and I'm a graduate of
                        Wentworth Institute of Technology with a degree in
                        Computer Engineering. While having a curriculum based in
                        both Computer Science and computer hardware, I have
                        always had a stronger interest in the Computer Science
                        side of the courses. In college the largest project I
                        was a part of was when I worked with a team to develop
                        an application using the Spotify API, during the
                        creation of this I found that I leaned towards software
                        within my degree. While this may have been the case,
                        there was always an itch for finding different ways to
                        try and break anything technology related. This would begin
                        a dive into the world of cybersecurity and all the various 
                        technologies encompassed within it. Currently I am working
                        as help desk support with a desire to become a Security 
                        Engineer.

                        In my free time I am still a huge nerd, when I'm not studying 
                        or learning I am either spending time on YouTube watching tech
                        videos, playing video games, and building/coding custom 
                        mechanical keyboards which you can find
